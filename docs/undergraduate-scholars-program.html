<p>The HEDCO Institute Undergraduate Scholars Program (UGSP) is a
multidisciplinary program designed to support future generations of
educators, education researchers, and outreach and communication
specialists. Our program provides students with rigorous training in
research synthesis, effective evidence translation, and/or fostering
research-practice partnerships with the ultimate goal of increasing the
use of evidence-based practices in K-12 education.</p>
<p><strong>Specialty Areas</strong></p>
<p>Scholars in the program gain training and experience in three specialty
areas:</p>
<p><strong>Research Synthesis:</strong> This specialty includes training in conducting
systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and other evidence reviews and
synthesis products to meet the decision-making needs of K-12 leaders.
Students will gain experience with prioritizing topics for evidence
reviews, conducting systematic literature reviews, collecting data for
systemic reviews, conducting statistical meta-analyses, writing up
results for publication in journals and presentations at conferences,
and other areas of research synthesis methodology.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge Mobilization:</strong> This specialty includes training in
translating evidence syntheses into digestible, easy-to-understand
products that are meaningful to educators (e.g., infographics, videos,
practice briefs, practice guides, toolkits). Students will gain
experience with co-creating evidence translation strategies, designing
translational research products, and developing dissemination plans for
various K-12 education audiences (e.g., teachers, principals,
superintendents, school district staff, policymakers).</p>
<p><strong>Interest-holder Engagement:</strong> This specialty includes training in
applying strategies to identify, engage, and inspire K-12 education
interest-holders in using research to guide education practice and to
engage with the HEDCO Institute. Students will gain experience with
identifying relevant interest-holders, working with interest-holders to
guide the work of HEDCO Institute, as well as developing tools and
materials to support interest-holders’ efforts to communicate and share
the work of the HEDCO Institute.</p>
<p><strong>Student Benefits:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Receive a $12,000 stipend to be distributed over the course of the
calendar year.</p></li>
<li><p>Participate in professional development, scholarship, and research
activities as a part of a prestigious cohort of top scholars.</p></li>
<li><p>Gain applied research experience and evidence translation skills
that are crucial to be an effective educational research-practice
partner.</p></li>
<li><p>IMPORTANT: If students are receiving federal financial aid, this
award may affect financial aid eligibility. Students who receive
federal aid have a responsibility to report all awards earned to the
UO Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships. Contact <a href="https://financialaid.uoregon.edu">Financial Aid

Symposium</a> each spring to showcase
undergraduate research occurring across campus. Participation is open to
HEDCO Institute scholars but is entirely voluntary. Scholars complete
their program in December; those interested in presenting at the
symposium on their work resulting from the program would present the
following spring. Participants can present individually or as a cohort,
and the presentation format is flexible. HEDCO Institute faculty/staff
will support scholars interested in presenting at the symposium. Please
speak with your faculty mentor if you are interested in exploring this
opportunity further.</p>
<p><strong>Scholar Bio</strong></p>
<p>You will be asked to write a brief bio that HEDCO Institute staff can
share (with your permission). Examples of who we might share your bio
with: COE leadership/faculty/staff; donors; etc. Here is a basic
template:</p>
<ul>
<li>Year in school (Example: “I am in my second year at the UO” or “I am
a sophomore at the UO”)</li>
<li>Major, minors</li>
<li>Career aspirations</li>
<li>“By participating in this program, [your first name here] hopes
to…”</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Communicating with us</strong></p>
<p><strong>Email</strong>: You can expect to receive program information via email.
While Canvas will be your “go to” for files, calendar,
assignments/activities, etc., UO email will be used to facilitate
program administration such as scheduling.</p>
<p><strong>Teams</strong>: You will use Teams for quick back &amp; forth messages, sharing
kudos, and other general updates that do not need to be
documented/recorded/tracked. Think of using Teams for our inter-office
“messaging” or “chatting” – this is typically used for things where you
need a quick reply/answer but don’t need a formal email chain.</p>
<p><strong>Canvas</strong>: All files, assignments/activities/projects, key dates
(calendar) are located on Canvas. There are two types of Canvas sites at
the UO:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Academic Instance (which you use for classes), and</p></li>
<li><p>Community Instance (which are for non-CRN courses and resources)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We will be using the Community Instance of Canvas for this program (see
image on the right below). The name of our Community Instance Canvas
site is “HEDCO Institute Undergraduate Scholars Program”.</p>
<p>To log in to this site, please go to
<a href="https://community.uoregon.edu/">community.uoregon.edu</a>. You will login
using your Duck ID and password (similar to a Canvas course).</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.3</span> Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)<a href="undergraduate-scholars-program.html#frequently-asked-questions-faqs" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p><strong>1. Will my award be taxed?</strong></p>
<p>The UO (University of Oregon) does not remove taxes before distributing
the award to student accounts but does inform the IRS (Internal Revenue
Service) of the award. The UO completes a Form 1098-T:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Qualified tuition/fees paid by the student in box 1</p></li>
<li><p>Total scholarships received by the student (including this award) in
box 5.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The student can consult a tax accountant regarding any tax implications
to be aware of as a result of receiving this award.</p>
<p>International students should check with Joy Germack, Senior Tax
Accountant/Analyst, <a href="mailto:jgermack@uoregon.edu" class="email">jgermack@uoregon.edu</a>, 541-346-0782, on possible
international tax implications.</p>
<p>Further questions about the Form 1098-T can be directed to Lara Grant,
Student Billing, <a href="mailto:lkgrant@uoregon.edu" class="email">lkgrant@uoregon.edu</a>, 541-346-1086, for more info.</p>

<p><strong>2. Do I need to be enrolled in classes during summer term to receive
the stipend?</strong></p>
<p>No, you do not need to be enrolled in classes during the summer term to
receive the stipend. But, please let program staff know if you will not
be enrolled in summer classes as we must inform Financial Aid &amp;
Scholarships in order for the stipend to be deposited into your account.</p>

<p><strong>Q: What is research synthesis?</strong></p>
<p>A. Research synthesis, or <a href="https://hedcoinstitute.uoregon.edu/what-we-do-what-evidence-synthesis">evidence
synthesis</a>,
is a term used to describe a variety of ways that researchers can
systematically summarize all of the research studies available to answer
a specific question. Research synthesis is an important and exciting
tool because it helps people working in a variety of fields (e.g.,
teachers, mental health clinicians, policymakers) make decisions based
on the entire body of evidence on a given topic.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What is knowledge mobilization?</strong></p>
<p>A: Knowledge mobilization is a term that includes a wide range of
activities used to make high-quality, research evidence about a
particular topic or issue accessible to the individuals and agencies who
can apply the information (e.g., school districts, teachers,
decision-makers). This may involve co-producing knowledge or co-creating
research products with non-researchers. Effective knowledge mobilization
is crucial for reducing the research-to-practice gap by helping
summarize research findings in a variety of ways and getting evidence
into the hands of education interest-holders. Working collaboratively
with stakeholders is a key piece to knowledge mobilization.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Who are interest-holders?</strong></p>
<p>A: An interest-holder is someone who has an interest in, or is affected
by, a given issue or topic. For example, there are many education
interest-holders. A teacher might be directly interested in how a
program delivered in the classroom promotes better student mental
health. A policymaker might be interested in that program because they
wonder if it is worth funding. A parent might be interested because they
want to know if that program will help their child. A student might be
interested because they want to know if the program will help them and
be enjoyable. Principals or educational leaders may be involved in
decisions about programs.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What is interest-holder engagement?</strong></p>
<p>A: Interest-holder engagement is a term used to describe the process of
identifying, motivating, and involving interest-holders in all steps
towards reaching a desired goal. This may include seeking input on which
research questions are most pressing to answer, as well as determining
how and who to tailor dissemination products to so they can have the
largest impact. By collaborating with interest-holders, we can tailor
our efforts and products to best meet the needs and desires of those
most affected by certain topics.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How is knowledge mobilization different from interest-holder
engagement?</strong></p>
<p>A: Both knowledge mobilization and interest-holder engagement are key
components to evidence translation. Knowledge mobilization involves
working with interest-holders to figure out how to effectively
communicate scientific results to various audiences. Thus,
interest-holder engagement is a critical element of effective knowledge
mobilization. On the other hand, interest-holder engagement involves a
wide range of strategies used to communicate directly with
interest-holders and guide them towards an innovative solution to their
problems. Depending on the goal of the interest-holders, this may not
always include knowledge mobilization.</p>
